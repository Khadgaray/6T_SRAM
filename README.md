## Standard 6T SRAM cell
##### <p> <h5> A Static Random Access Memory(SRAM) is a memory storage device which stores the data as long as Supply Volatge is provided to the circuit. The SRAM memory design ckts consume less power as compared to DRAMs and also the SRAM does not need any periodic refresh to contain the stored value. The SRAM ckt consist of two inverters connected back to back with each other and two Nmos transistors which act as access transisters.</h5></p>
